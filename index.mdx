## Projects · Build in one workspace

Plan privately and share when you are ready. Projects are private by default, public by choice—perfect for access-driven fandom.

**Visibility controls**

- Keep it private until the narrative clicks.
- Flip individual blocks to Public, Supporters-only, or Members-only when you want feedback, fuel, or momentum.

**Rich media + visibility layer**

- Tasks, moments, media, and calls-to-action stay in one place.
- Publish without leaving the workspace; supporters see the polished view immediately.

**Storyboard wall**

Layer progress notes, media, and CTA buttons beside each milestone. Every block is publish-ready, so handing off the link is effortless.

**✦ Jot Assistant**

Transform loose notes into publish-ready drafts without leaving your launch workspace. Show Jot a couple of past highlights and it returns copy that sounds like you—ideal for drafting clean, concise feature sections.

## Feed & Support · Show momentum, unlock backing

Share updates the moment work moves forward—or drop something ad hoc when inspiration hits. Text, images, and YouTube embeds publish from the same workspace, whether it’s a quick note or a fully formed post.
