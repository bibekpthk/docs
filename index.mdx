  Journi is where creators share the making, not just the finished work.
</tip>

This documentation helps you use Journi to set up your space, share updates, invite people into your process, and accept support—without turning your creative work into constant performance.

Journi is designed for creators who are building something over time and want their audience to follow along, react, and support as the work takes shape.

## What Journi Is

Journi is a creator platform focused on process, momentum, and continuity.

Instead of only publishing polished outcomes, Journi lets you:

- Share notes, drafts, images, and videos as you work.
- Decide what’s public, supporter-only, or member-only.
- Let supporters follow progress and engage along the way.
- Accept one-time support or recurring memberships.

Journi works best when you treat it as a living workspace — not a highlight reel.

## Who Journi Is For

Journi is built for:

- Creators who want to build in public or semi-private.
- People balancing creation with real life, not chasing algorithms.
- Supporters who care about the journey, not just the result.

If you’re documenting progress, experimenting, or shipping in cycles, Journi fits naturally.
