Each creator has a public page — a quiet, cozy corner — with a unified feed of posts, photos, and videos. It’s meant for in‑progress thoughts, drafts, and everyday updates that bring supporters closer.

### What you can do
- Scroll the feed to see the latest items across content types.
- Open individual items to view details, comments, and reactions.
- Share a post or profile using the share icon on the page.
- If you’re the creator, you can create a post directly from here by selecting the share icon and following the prompt.
