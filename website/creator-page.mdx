Each creator has a public page with a unified feed of posts, photos, and videos.

### What you can do
- Scroll the feed to see the latest items across content types.
- Open individual items to view details, comments, and reactions.
- Share a post or profile using the share icon on the page.
- If you’re the creator, you can create a post directly from here by selecting the share icon and following the prompt.

### Content visibility
- Some items may be for members only. Join a membership to unlock them.
- Video thumbnails may come from YouTube where applicable.
