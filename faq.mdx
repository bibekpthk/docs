### What is a “cup of coffee”?
It’s a one‑time support (donation) you can send to a creator. Quantities translate to currency amounts.

### What’s the difference between supporters and members?
- Supporters buy a one‑time cup of coffee. They can access Public and Supporter‑only posts.
- Members join a paid membership tier with benefits. They can access all content, including Members‑only and Supporter‑only.

### How do memberships work?
Creators can offer paid tiers with benefits. Joining a tier unlocks members‑only content and appears in your analytics.

### Can I change my username?
Usernames cannot be changed and are part of your public URL. Choose a name that matches your creator profile.

### How do I cash out earnings?
Creators do not need to request withdrawals. Earnings are deposited into the connected bank account on a rolling basis. A Stripe connection is required for monetization and payouts.

### How do I reactivate a deactivated account?
Simply sign in again. If your email is verified, your account reactivates automatically.

### How do I report content?
Use the report feature on public pages to submit a report. Abuse is rate‑limited to prevent spam.

### How do I get help?
