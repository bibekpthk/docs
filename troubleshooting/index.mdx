<Callout type="note" emoji="🌍">
Note for Nepal: Nepal is not currently an enabled region. Nepal is near and dear to us, and we’re working tirelessly on a cross‑border payment flow so creators in Nepal can receive payouts in both USD and NPR. Until this launches, KYC, monetization, and payouts are unavailable in Nepal. See [Regional Availability](/regional-availability).
