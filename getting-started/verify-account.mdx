After signing up, you will receive a verification code by email. Email verification is required; phone verification is optional where enabled.
</Callout>

<Steps>
1. Check your inbox for the code.
2. You’ll be redirected to the verification page automatically after sign in.
   <br/>
   If you aren’t redirected, open it directly:
   <Button href="https://chiyapasal.me/user/authorization" newTab>Open Verification Page</Button>
3. Enter your verification code and submit.
4. If you did not receive the code, select <b>Resend Code</b> on the same screen.
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⏱️">
Verification codes expire. If the code times out, select Resend Code and try again.

## Add Extra Security (2FA)

<Callout type="tip" emoji="🔐">
To add extra security later, enable Two‑factor Authentication (2FA) from your Account Settings using a time‑based one‑time password app (e.g., Google Authenticator or Authy).
