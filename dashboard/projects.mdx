Projects lives inside Dashboard and opens as a board view at [journi.me/user/project/index](http://journi.me/user/project/index). Count every stage of a project from first spark to finished story.

### Board view & status
- Projects appear on a board segmented by status columns: **Draft**, **Research**, **In Progress**, **Review**, and **Done**.
- Click **+ New Project** to start a fresh draft or open an existing one to continue the thread.
- Every project card lands in the board by its current status and can move columns as you update the work.

### Creating & editing projects
- A rich text editor (RTE) loads when you open or create a project, letting you draft rich text, attach media, and lay out your story while capturing the messy middle of content creation.
- Use the RTE navbar to set the project’s current **Status**, choosing from the same options that organize the board.
- The RTE also surfaces **Jot**, the AI assistant that can seed drafts from a prompt or learn from completed projects you’ve already published.

### Visibility & sharing
- Projects are **Private by default**; nothing auto-publishes until you flag it.
- Behind-the-scenes blocks and BTS cards default to **Public** but can be changed with the **Visibility** dropdown and toggle to **Supporter Only** or **Members Only**.
- If the project has no visible blocks selected and no BTS card attached, its overall visibility remains Private.
- You may highlight a Sponsor on the project if you want to credit a campaign partner; manage sponsors via [journi.me/user/sponsor/index](http://journi.me/user/sponsor/index).

Every project keeps your fans in the loop while letting you control what stays private and what becomes a behind-the-scenes share.
