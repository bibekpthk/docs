Monetization shows your earnings and balances, and the status of payouts. If Stripe isn’t connected yet, this page provides a “Connect Stripe” option to onboard for payouts.

### Connect Stripe (Payouts)
<Steps>
1. Open Dashboard → Account Settings.
2. If available for your country, connect your Stripe account.
3. Complete onboarding steps in Stripe.
4. Return to Journi to confirm connection status.
</Steps>

Payout availability depends on your country.

Note for Nepal: Nepal is not currently an enabled region. Nepal is near and dear to us, and we’re working tirelessly on a cross‑border payment flow so creators in Nepal can receive payouts in both USD and NPR. Until this launches, monetization and payouts are unavailable in Nepal.

In other supported countries, connect Stripe and complete its onboarding; Stripe handles identity verification, monetization onboarding, and payouts. See [Regional Availability](/regional-availability).
