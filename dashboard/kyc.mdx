Nepal is not currently an enabled region. Nepal is near and dear to us, and we’re working tirelessly on a cross‑border payment flow so creators in Nepal can receive payouts in both USD and NPR. Until this launches, KYC, monetization, and payouts are unavailable in Nepal. For creators in other supported countries, payouts and identity verification are handled by Stripe during onboarding.

If KYC is required for your account, you’ll see a banner on the dashboard.

<Steps>
1. Open Dashboard → KYC.
2. Complete the form and upload documents.
3. Submit and wait for review.
