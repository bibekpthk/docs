KYC is only required for Nepal. Nepal is not currently an enabled region. Nepal is near and dear to us, and we’re working tirelessly on a cross‑border payment flow so creators in Nepal can receive payouts in both USD and NPR. Until this launches, KYC, monetization, and payouts are unavailable in Nepal.

For all currently supported countries, Stripe handles verification and monetization onboarding during Stripe Connect onboarding. No additional KYC is performed inside Chiya Pasal for these countries.

If Chiya Pasal KYC becomes required for your account (e.g., when Nepal support launches), you’ll see a banner on the dashboard.

<Steps>
1. Open Dashboard → KYC. (Visible only when applicable.)
2. Complete the form and upload documents.
3. Submit and wait for review.
