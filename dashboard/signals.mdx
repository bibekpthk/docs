Signals turns your latest YouTube stats into one clear next step. It won’t post for you, chase vanity metrics, or guess your goals. Review the insight, start or update a project, or dismiss it—every response teaches Signals.

Connect your YouTube channel before visiting [Signals](http://journi.me/user/signals) so the workspace can analyze your data.

### Getting started
- Connect your YouTube channel and return to Signals to see the "View my first insight" button on the Signals page.
- Click "View my first insight" to surface the recommendation, evidence, and actions that you can take right away.
- Each insight lands in the **Latest signal** block, which keeps the current recommendation and workspace actions front and center.

### Cadence & freshness
- **Manual refresh:** tap refresh once every 24 hours when you want a new look at the data.
- **Auto refresh:** Signals updates automatically after new uploads and during weekly reviews, delivering a new recommendation roughly 48 hours after each fresh upload.
- **Expiry:** insights expire after seven days, keeping only the most current next steps visible.

### Recommendation intelligence
Signals analyzes your connected channel to understand what’s working and what could improve. Each recommendation is paired with a confidence badge (low, medium, or high) based on channel metrics.

### Acting on a signal
- Use the buttons inside **Latest signal** to create a new project or attach the recommendation to an existing project—every action trains Signals to understand the projects you value.
- Provide feedback (Prioritize, Blocker, Not Useful) so the next batch of recommendations better matches your goals.
- Supporting evidence lives in the **Supporting evidence** block, highlighting the channel metrics and data that explain why Signals suggested that step.
